        <!--Main Info-->
                <main class="box">
            <h2>General Interests</h2>
            <p>Like I previously mentioned in my general "About" section, I'm into reading, writing, anime, and K-pop.
            <ul>
                <li>Reading: I mostly read fiction as I feel it lets people truly express themselves creatively, and it's just what catches my interest the best. 
                    One of my recent favorites is called Blood On The Tracks.</li>

                <li>Writing: I've been writing stories since my youth, mostly just for fun and to branch out on my own creative ideas or plots that usually don't get finished before I lose inspiration.</li>

                <li>Anime: I've been into this practically my whole life, I'd say some of my favorite genres are Shoujo, Slice-of-life, Shounen, and Drama.</li>

                <li>Gaming: I'm really not a big gamer, but I do enjoy playing games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Persona 3-5.</li>
            </p>
            <h2>Favorite Film</h2>
            <p> I'm honestly not a big fan of movies, but if I had to pick a favorite as of late, I would say <b>Perfect Blue</b>.
              A psychological thriller anime movie directed by Satoshi Kon. The animation is absolutely stunning, and the plot is super intriguing. It's about a pop idol named Mima who decides to leave her group to pursue an acting career,
                    But things take a dark turn when she starts receiving threatening messages from a stalker and begins to lose her grip on reality.</p>

                </div>
        <h2>Favorite Show</h2>
        <p> 
            For my favorite show, I would have to say <b>Desperate Housewives</b> as I binged it halfway through 2024 and finished it over the summer.
            I was just randomly scrolling around and ended up watching the first episode, thinking it'd be boring, but it ended up being super addictive, and 
            some of the crazy plot points kept drawing me back.
        </p>

        <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
        <p> This is honestly the hardest section to put an answer to because, like many, I have a lot of favorite songs, and it's hard to even just put one on display.</p>
