          <h2>Education/Work Experience</h2>
                <p> In terms of Education, I currently only have my High school diploma which I earned in 2023.
                    I'm currently studying to earn my CompTIA A certifcation but that's still some time away.
                Aside from that, my only other cert I have to show is my Microsoft Office Specailist certifcation for WORD 2019 that I got back in 2022. </p>
                As for work experince, the list is looking a little thin...( ;Â´ - `;)
