            <h2>General Interests</h2>
            <p>Like I previously mentioned on my general "About" section, I'm into reading, writing, anime, and kpop.
            <ul>
                <li>Reading: I mostly read fiction as I feel it lets people truly express themseleves creatively and it's just what catches my interest the best. 
                    One of my recent favorites is called Blood On The Tracks.</li>

                <li>Writing: I've been writing stories since youth mostly just for fun and to branch out on my own creative ideas or plots that usually don't get finished before I lose inspiration.</li>

                <li>Anime: I've been into this pratically my whole life, I'd say some of my favortire genres are Shoujo, Slice-of-life, Shounen, and Drama.</li>

                <li>Gaming: I'm really not a big gamer, but I do enjoy playing games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Persona 3-5.</li>
            </p>
            <h2>Favorite Film</h2>
            <p> I'm honestly not a big fan of movies but if I had to pick a favorite as of late, I would say <b>Perfect Blue</b>.
                Released in 1998, the film follows Mima a young Japanese singer who makes a career change to acting which is followed by demanding and strange scenarios. </p>

        <header><h2>Favorite Show</h2></header>
        <p> 
            For my favorite show, I would have to say <b>Desperate Housewives</b> as I binged it halfway through 2024 and finished it over the summer.
            I was just randomly scrolling around and ended up watching the first episode thinking It'd be boring but it ended up being super addictive and 
            some of the crazy plot points kept drawing me back.

        <h2>Favorite Song</h2>
        <p> This is honestly the hardest section to put an answer because like many, I have a lot of favorite songs and It's hard to even just put one on display.</p>
